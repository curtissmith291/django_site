			Project Description

			"Find a project that aligns with your interests."
			<br>
			<br>
			This is a common piece of advice given to any new programmers; it can be difficult for concepts to truly sink in
			when just doing homework or working on datasets that spark no personal creativity. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Enter this project.
			<br>
			<br>
			I've played guitar for about 5 years, but recently started getting into music theory; while reading The Idiot's Guide
			to Guitar Theory, I began to realize that notes, scales, and chords are all just math (well, like 95% anyways... There 
			always seems to be room for some creative dissonant sounds). I figured creating a program to that would tell me what 
			chord I was playing would help tremendously when learning all of the patterns necessary to build up the foundation 
			for understanding music theory. 
			<br>
			<br>
			How this project works: the user input fret numbers get converted into notes by looking up their value in a dictionary. 
			As there are only 12 notes in the chromatic scale, the dictionary only needs to be 12 items long; however, as there are
			more than 12 frets for any given string, "12" is subtracted until the input notes are between null and 12 (null for a 
			muted string) - so this code could work for a guitar with any length of neck. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The converted notes are then run through some funtions to calculate the respective chords for the input root note (the 
			note played on the lowest string). For example: if the input root note is "G", the program calculates the degrees of the
			G Major scale (e.g., the root, minor third, perfect fifth, major seventh, etc.). Using those calculated degrees, a large
			number of chords can be constructed. The G Minor chord is comprised of the root, minor third, and perfect fifth degrees. 
			As all the degrees are calculated, the degrees are run through functions that return the correct degree.
			<br>
			<br>
			This resuts in an output displaying the chord entered (if any; there are definitely combinations of frets that do not
			correspond to any chord structure). Additinionally, the chord structures for the entered root note are returned. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Lastly, this is a stepping stone for the more useful, and ambitious, project that will sort of do the reverse of this 
			project: inputting the key you want to play in and outputting the chords (and fret positions) for the input key.
